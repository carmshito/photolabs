# Photolabs
PhotoLabs is a React-based single-page application that allows users to view photos in different contexts.

Users can:

* view photos from the homepage loaded from the API.
* navigate to different photo categories, also called topics.
* click on a photo to view a larger version of the photo and relevant / similar photos.
* like and unlike a photo from anywhere within the application where the photo is displayed.
* view a heart icon with a notification in the navigation if there are liked photos.
